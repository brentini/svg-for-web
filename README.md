SVG for Web
===========

SVG for Web is a Fireworks plugin and is a modified version of [Export](http://fireworks.abeall.com/extensions/commands/Export/) by Aaron Beall.

Requirements
------------
* Fireworks CS3 or later

Installation
------------
* [Download the plugin](https://github.com/joshje/svg-for-web/archive/master.zip)
* Run `svg-for-web.mxp`

Usage
-----
This plugin can be found in `Commands → SVG for Web`

The command `Export SVG` will ask you for the following information:

* Whether to only export selected items (if any items are selected)
* How many decimal places of precision you’d like
* Whether to set the width and height to 100% so the resulting SVG scales automatically
* Where to save the file

If you want to use the following defaults, choose `Export SVG Quick` instead:

* Export selected items if there is a selection
* One decimal place of precision
* Scale the SVG to 100%
